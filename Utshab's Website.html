                <h2>Biography</h2>

                <p>“Ankha chhopi narou bhani bhannu parya chha … Mutumathi dhunga rakhi hasnu parya chha…”

                    There would be hardly anyone in Nepal who does not know the lyrics of the song or the man behind the
                    scenes with his magical voice. Narayan Gopal is a name that resonates in most of most music lovers
                    in Nepal, and many of them still listen to his songs with the same adoration. Even after some three
                    decades of his death, he is still a popular icon for Nepal.

                    Yet, there are only a handful of people who knew the Swar Samrat closely.

                    Narayan Gopal was talented and famous in his musical endeavours, no doubt, but he was equally
                    infamous and landed in many controversies too. But those close to him say many of them were either
                    speculation or hearsay. Here, we discuss some unknown stories about him as shared by a few people
                    close to him.
                </p>

                <p> Narayan Gopal Gurubacharya (also spelt Guruwacharya) was the second eldest son born to father Aasha
                    Gopal and mother Ram Devi Gurubacharya on October 4, 1939. He had eight siblings including five
                    brothers and three sisters.

                    As he grew up in a musical family, he was influenced by his father, a sitar maestro of his own time.
                    Growing up, he learned many musical instruments but was particularly popular for playing harmonium
                    and tabala.

                    “Father was a teacher of musical instruments, and he had told Narayan dai (elder brother) to not go
                    into vocals [of modern genre]. But as we know he did not listen; as a rebel, [Narayan] dai went into
                    vocals and garnered such unsurmountable level of fame and appreciation,” remembers Laxman Gopal
                    Gurubacharya, Narayan Gopal's youngest brother.

                    Narayan Gopal's closest of friends, Manik Ratna, Prem Dhoj Pradhan, Gopal Yonjan, Bhoj Raj Sharma
                    and Nagendra Thapa played key roles from recognising his melodic voice to getting him into the
                    singing genre full time.
                </p>

                <p> “Father was not happy that dai was singing and used to scold him so much, even restricting him into
                    the house at times. But, he used to sneak out and go for musical practice with his friends. If he
                    came home late, our father would not give him food and lock him in his room. But, he was loved by
                    our mother. She would sneak in food to dai in a basket, with a rope, from one window to his window
                    below,” remembers Laxman Gopal.

                    Other than being a musical genius, Narayan Gopal was well known for his love for food. “He was a
                    true foodie. If he wanted to eat something, he would buy the ingredients and even cook for himself.
                    He also loved occasional drinking too. And because of his food habits, dai was not that popular in
                    gatherings.”
                </p>

                <p>Just like the depth of romanticism in his evergreen songs, Narayan Gopal was a person full of such
                    feelings too. “Not many know how romantic dai was. Everyone knows of his love for bhauju, Pemala
                    Lama, whom he met in Darjeeling. But what people do not know is he went to Darjeeling because of
                    another love interest,” Laxman Gopal reveals, “He had gone there to woo a girl. But, due to some
                    circumstances, he broke up and instead met bhauju [sister-in-law] there. They were inseparable from
                    there.”

                    “When he came back to Nepal with Pemala, father was not happy. Being from a local Newa family of
                    that time, our father was strict and did not approve of their (intercaste) marriage. But, he stood
                    by bhauju and left home. They went from one place to another, first to Pokhara, then Hetaunda, then
                    Bhagwanpur, Thamel and then to Maharajgunj that many know today.”
